**TL;DR:** In the first part of this tutorial, we introduced the Elm language by building a [simple Elm Application that called an API](https://auth0.com/blog/creating-your-first-elm-app-part-1/). Now we'll authenticate with JSON Web Tokens to make protected API requests. The full code is available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/kmaida/auth0-elm-with-jwt-api).

Elm is a reactive language that compiles to JavaScript. Its robust compiler and static typing make it a nice option for developing applications for the browser that are free of runtime errors. In the first part of this Elm tutorial, we built a small web app to introduce the language and its syntax. 

## Authenticating the Chuck Norris Quoter App

Now we'll continue to build out our Chuck Norris Quoter app to add user registration, login, and make authenticated API requests with JSON Web Tokens. We'll also use JavaScript interop to persist user sessions with local storage.

### Registering a User

Last time, we finished up by retrieving Chuck Norris quotes from the API. We also need registration so users can be issued [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/learn/json-web-tokens) with which to access protected quotes. We'll create a form that submits a `POST` request to the API to create a new user and return a token.

![elm quote](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YiMihi/elm-with-jwt/master/article-assets/step3a.jpg)

After the user has registered, we'll display a welcome message:

![elm quote](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YiMihi/elm-with-jwt/master/article-assets/step3b.jpg)

Here's the complete `Main.elm` code for this step:

**[Main.elm - Registering a User](https://github.com/kmaida/auth0-elm-with-jwt-api/blob/step-3/src/Main.elm)**

Starting with new imports:

```elm
import Json.Decode as Decode exposing (..)
import Json.Encode as Encode exposing (..)
```

We'll be sending objects and receiving JSON now instead of just working with a string API response, so we need to be able to translate these from and to Elm records.

```elm
{- 
    MODEL
    * Model type 
    * Initialize model with empty values
    * Initialize with a random quote
-}

type alias Model =
    { username : String
    , password : String
    , token : String
    , quote : String
    , errorMsg : String
    }
    
init : (Model, Cmd Msg)
init =
    ( Model "" "" "" "" "", fetchRandomQuoteCmd )
```

Our model needs to hold more data than just a quote now. We've added `username`, `password`, `token`, and `errorMsg` (to display any API errors from authentication).

We'll initialize our application with empty strings for all of the above.

```elm
{-
    UPDATE
    * API routes
    * GET and POST
    * Encode request body 
    * Decode responses
    * Messages
    * Update case
-}

-- API request URLs  
    
...
    
registerUrl : String
registerUrl =
    api ++ "users"
```

The API route for `POST`ing new users is [http://localhost:3001/users](http://localhost:3001/users) so we'll create `registerUrl` to store this.
  
```elm
-- Encode user to construct POST request body (for Register and Log In)
    
userEncoder : Model -> Encode.Value
userEncoder model = 
    Encode.object 
        [ ("username", Encode.string model.username)
        , ("password", Encode.string model.password) 
        ]          
```

The API expects the request body for registration and login to be a JavaScript object in string format that looks like this: `{ username: "string", password: "string" }`

An Elm record is not the same as a JavaScript object so we need to [encode](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.1/Json-Encode#encode) the applicable properties of our model before we can send them with the HTTP request. The `userEncoder` function utilizes [`Json.Encode.object`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.1/Json-Encode#object) to take the model and return the encoded value.

```elm
-- POST register / login request
    
authUser : Model -> String -> Task Http.Error String
authUser model apiUrl =
    { verb = "POST"
    , headers = [ ("Content-Type", "application/json") ]
    , url = apiUrl
    , body = Http.string <| Encode.encode 0 <| userEncoder model
    }
    |> Http.send Http.defaultSettings
    |> Http.fromJson tokenDecoder 
```    

We'll use a [fully specified HTTP request](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-http/3.0.1/Http#Request) this time as opposed to the simple `getString` used for the quote in the previous step. The same settings can be used for both register and login with the exception of the API route which we'll pass in an argument.

We'll call this effect function `authUser` (for "authenticate a user"). The type says "`authUser` takes model as an argument and a string as an argument and returns a task that fails with an error or succeeds with a string".

Let's take a closer look at these lines:

```elm
...
    , body = Http.string <| Encode.encode 0 <| userEncoder model
    }
    |> Http.send Http.defaultSettings
    |> Http.fromJson tokenDecoder
```

`<|` and `|>` are aliases for function application to reduce parentheses. [`<|` is backward function application](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.1/Basics#%3C|). 

`body = Http.string <| Encode.encode 0 <| userEncoder model` takes the results of the last function and passes it as the last argument to the function on its left. Written with parentheses, the equivalent would be: `body = Http.string (Encode.encode 0 (userEncoder model))`

We'll run the `userEncoder` function to encode the request body. Then [`Json.Encode.encode`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.1/Json-Encode#encode) converts the resulting value to a prettified string with no (`0`) indentation. Finally, we provide the resulting string as the request body with [`Http.String`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-http/3.0.1/Http#string).

Next we have [forward function application performed with `|>`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.1/Basics#|%3E) to send the HTTP request with default settings and then take the JSON result and decode it with a `tokenDecoder` function that we'll create in a moment.

We now have our `authUser` effect so we need to create an `authUserCmd` command. This should look familiar from fetching quotes earlier. We're also passing the API route as an argument. We'll create the `AuthError` and `GetTokenSuccess` messages shortly.

```elm
authUserCmd : Model -> String -> Cmd Msg    
authUserCmd model apiUrl = 
    Task.perform AuthError GetTokenSuccess <| authUser model apiUrl
```

Because `authUser` takes arguments, we'll use `<|` to tell the app that the `model` and `apiUrl` belong to `authUser` and not to `Task.perform`.

We'll also define the `tokenDecoder` function that ensures we can work with the response from the HTTP request:

```elm   
-- Decode POST response to get token
    
tokenDecoder : Decoder String
tokenDecoder =
    "id_token" := Decode.string
``` 

When registering or logging in a user, the response from the API is JSON shaped like this:

```elm
{
    "id_token": "someJWTTokenString"
}
```

Recall that `:` means "has type" in Elm. We'll take the `id_token` and extract its contents as a string that will be returned on success.   

Now we will do something with the result and set up a way for our UI to interact with the model:

```elm
-- Messages

type Msg 
    ...
    | AuthError Http.Error
    | SetUsername String
    | SetPassword String
    | ClickRegisterUser
    | GetTokenSuccess String

-- Update

update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
    case msg of
        ...  

        AuthError error ->
            ( { model | errorMsg = (toString error) }, Cmd.none )  

        SetUsername username ->
            ( { model | username = username }, Cmd.none )

        SetPassword password ->
            ( { model | password = password }, Cmd.none )

        ClickRegisterUser ->
            ( model, authUserCmd model registerUrl )

        GetTokenSuccess newToken ->
            ( { model | token = newToken, password = "", errorMsg = "" } |> Debug.log "got new token", Cmd.none )
```  

We want to display authentication errors to the user. Unlike the `HttpError` message we implemented earlier, `AuthError` won't discard its argument. The type of the `error` argument is [`Http.Error`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-http/3.0.1/Http#Error). As you can see from the docs, this is a union type that could be a few different errors. For the sake of simplicity, we're going to convert the error to a string and update the model's `errorMsg` with that string. A good exercise later would be to translate the different errors to more user-friendly messaging.

The `SetUsername` and `SetPassword` messages are for sending form field values to update the model. `ClickRegisterUser` is the `onClick` for our "Register" button. It runs the `authUserCmd` command we just created and passes the model and the API route for new user creation. 

`GetTokenSuccess` is the success function for the `authUser` task. Its argument is the token string. We'll update our model with the token so we can use it to request protected quotes later. We've also authenticated the user now, so we can clear the password and any errors. This is a good place to verify that everything is working as expected, so let's log the updated model to the browser console using the `|>` forward function application alias and a [`Debug.log`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.1/Debug#log): `{ model | token = newToken, password = "", errorMsg = "" } |> Debug.log "got new token"`. After verifying our expectations in the browser console, we should remove the `Debug.log`.

```elm

                        h3 [ class "text-center" ] [ text greeting ]
                        , p [ class "text-center" ] [ text "You have super-secret access to protected quotes." ]  
                    ] 
                else
                    div [ id "form" ] [
                        h2 [ class "text-center" ] [ text "Log In or Register" ]

                            div [ class "col-md-offset-2 col-md-8" ] [

                                , input [ id "username", type' "text", class "form-control", Html.Attributes.value model.username, onInput SetUsername ] []
                            ]    
                        ]
                        , div [ class "form-group row" ] [
                            div [ class "col-md-offset-2 col-md-8" ] [
                                label [ for "password" ] [ text "Password:" ]

                            ]    
                        ]
                        , div [ class "text-center" ] [
                            button [ class "btn btn-link", onClick ClickRegisterUser ] [ text "Register" ]
                        ] 
                    ]
                           
    in
        div [ class "container" ] [
            h2 [ class "text-center" ] [ text "Chuck Norris Quotes" ]
            , p [ class "text-center" ] [
                button [ class "btn btn-success", onClick GetQuote ] [ text "Grab a quote!" ]
            ]
            -- Blockquote with quote
            , blockquote [] [ 
                p [] [text model.quote] 
            ]
            , div [ class "jumbotron text-left" ] [
                -- Login/Register form or user greeting
                authBoxView
            ]
        ]
```

There's a lot of new stuff in the view but it's mostly form HTML. We'll start with some logic to hide the form once the user is authenticated; we want to show a greeting in this case.

Remember that `view` is a function. This means we can do things like create scoped variables with [`let` expressions](http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax#let-expressions) to conditionally render parts of the view.

For the sake of simplicity, we'll check if the model's token string has a length to determine if the user is logged in. In a real-world application, token verification might be performed in a route callback to ensure proper UI access. For our Chuck Norris Quoter, the token is needed to get protected quotes so all the `loggedIn` variable does is show the form vs. a simple greeting.

We'll then create the `authBoxView`. This contains the form and greeting and executes either depending on the value of `loggedIn`. We'll also display the authentication error if there is one.

If the user is logged in, we'll greet them by their username and inform them that they have super-secret access to protected quotes.

If the user is not logged in, we'll display the Log In / Register form. We can use the same form to do both because they share the same request body. Right now though, we only have the functionality for Register prepared. 

After the heading, instructional copy, and conditional error alert, we need the `username` and `password` [form fields](http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/forms.html). We can supply various attributes:

```
input [ id "username", type' "text", class "form-control", Html.Attributes.value model.username, onInput SetUsername ] []
...
input [ id "password", type' "password", class "form-control", Html.Attributes.value model.password, onInput SetPassword ] []
```

There are a few things that may stand out here: `type'` has a single quote after it because `type` is a reserved keyword. Appending the quote has origins in the usage of the [prime symbol in mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#Use_in_mathematics.2C_statistics.2C_and_science). `Html.Attributes.value` is fully qualified because `value` alone is ambiguous in context because the compiler could confuse it with `Json.Decode.value`. `onInput` is a [custom event handler](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-html/4.0.2/Html-Events#targetValue) that gets values from triggered events. When these events are fired we want to update the username or password in the model.

After our form fields, we'll include a "Register" button with `onClick ClickRegisterUser`. We'll use Bootstrap's CSS to style this button like a link since it will live next to a Log In button later.

Finally, we'll use our `authBoxView` variable in the main view. We'll place it below our Chuck Norris quote in a jumbotron.

Now we can register new users in our app. When successfully registered, the user will receive a token and be authenticated. The view will then update to show the greeting message. Try it out in the browser. You should also try to trigger an error message!

### Logging In and Logging Out

Now that users can register, they need to be able to log in with existing accounts.

![elm quote](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YiMihi/elm-with-jwt/master/article-assets/step4a.jpg) 

We also need the ability to log out.

![elm quote](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YiMihi/elm-with-jwt/master/article-assets/step4b.jpg)

The full `Main.elm` code with login and logout implemented will look like this:

**[Main.elm - Logging In and Logging Out](https://github.com/kmaida/auth0-elm-with-jwt-api/blob/step-4/src/Main.elm)**

Login works like Register (and uses the same request body), so creating its functionality should be straightforward. 

```elm
-- API request URLs
    
... 
    
loginUrl : String
loginUrl =
    api ++ "sessions/create" 
```   

We'll add the login API route, which is [http://localhost:3001/sessions/create](http://localhost:3001/sessions/create).

We already have the `authUser` effect and `authUserCmd` command, so all we need to do is create a way for login to interact with the UI. We'll also create a logout.

```js
-- Messages

type Msg 
    ...
    | ClickLogIn
     ...
    | LogOut

-- Update

update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
    case msg of
         ...
         
        ClickLogIn ->
            ( model, authUserCmd model loginUrl ) 

        ...
            
        LogOut ->
            ( { model | username = "", protectedQuote = "", token = "" }, Cmd.none )
```

`ClickLogIn` runs the `authUserCmd` command with the appropriate arguments. `LogOut` resets authentication-related data in the model record to empty strings. We don't need to reset the `password` or `errorMsg` because we already did so when we successfully retrieved a token in `GetTokenSuccess`.

```elm
...

if loggedIn then
    div [id "greeting" ][
        h3 [ class "text-center" ] [ text greeting ]
        , p [ class "text-center" ] [ text "You have super-secret access to protected quotes." ]
        , p [ class "text-center" ] [
            button [ class "btn btn-danger", onClick LogOut ] [ text "Log Out" ]
        ]   
    ]
                    
...                    

, div [ class "text-center" ] [
    button [ class "btn btn-primary", onClick ClickLogIn ] [ text "Log In" ]
    , button [ class "btn btn-link", onClick ClickRegisterUser ] [ text "Register" ]
]

...

```

There are minimal updates to the view. We'll add a logout button in the greeting message in `authBoxView`. Then in the form we'll insert the login button before the register button.

Registered users can now log in and log out. Our application is really coming together!

>Note: A nice enhancement might be to show different forms for logging in and registering. Maybe the user should be asked to confirm their password when registering?

### Getting Protected Quotes

It's time to make authorized requests to the API to get protected quotes for authenticated users. Our logged out state will look like this:

![elm quote](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YiMihi/elm-with-jwt/master/article-assets/step5a.jpg) 

If a user is logged in, they'll be able to click a button to make API requests to get protected quotes:

![elm quote](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YiMihi/elm-with-jwt/master/article-assets/step5b-6.jpg)

Here's the completed `Main.elm` code for this step:

**[Main.elm - Getting Protected Quotes](https://github.com/kmaida/auth0-elm-with-jwt-api/blob/step-5/src/Main.elm)**

We're going to need a new package:

```elm
import Http.Decorators
```

We'll go into more detail regarding why this is needed when we make the `GET` request for the protected quotes.

```elm
{- 
    MODEL
    * Model type 
    * Initialize model with empty values
    * Initialize with a random quote
-}

type alias Model =
    { username : String
    , password : String
    , token : String
    , quote : String
    , protectedQuote : String 
    , errorMsg : String
    }
    
init : (Model, Cmd Msg)
init =
    ( Model "" "" "" "" "" "", fetchRandomQuoteCmd )
``` 

We're adding a `protectedQuote` property to the Model type alias. This will be a string. We'll add another pair of double quotes `""` to the `init` tuple to initialize our app with an empty string for the protected quote.

```js
-- API request URLs
    
...  
    
protectedQuoteUrl : String
protectedQuoteUrl = 
    api ++ "api/protected/random-quote"
```

Add the API route for the `protectedQuoteUrl`: [http://localhost:3001/api/protected/random-quote](http://localhost:3001/api/protected/random-quote).

```elm
-- GET request for random protected quote (authenticated)
    
fetchProtectedQuote : Model -> Task Http.Error String
fetchProtectedQuote model = 
    { verb = "GET"
    , headers = [ ("Authorization", "Bearer " ++ model.token) ]
    , url = protectedQuoteUrl
    , body = Http.empty
    }
    |> Http.send Http.defaultSettings  
    |> Http.Decorators.interpretStatus -- decorates Http.send result so error type is Http.Error instead of RawError
    |> Task.map responseText
```     

We'll create the HTTP request to `GET` the protected quote. The type for this request is "`fetchProtectedQuote` takes model as an argument and returns a task that fails with an error or succeeds with a string". This time we need to define an `Authorization` header. The value of this header is `Bearer ` plus the user's token string. We then `Http.send` the request with default settings like we did in `authUser`.

We're going to step through a typing challenge now. If we try to compile before adding `|> Http.Decorators.interpretStatus` we'll receive a type mismatch error. This API route returns a string instead of JSON like our `authUser` `POST` request. Elm infers that the type should be `Model -> Task Http.RawError String` but we've written `Http.Error` instead. We didn't have this problem getting the _unprotected_ quote because we used `Http.getString`. We can't use `getString` here because we need to pass a custom header. And because the response is not JSON, we can't use [`Http.fromJson`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-http/3.0.1/Http#fromJson) (which takes a `RawError` and returns an `Error`). We want the error type to be `Http.Error` because we want to use our pre-existing `HttpError` function in our command and `HttpError` expects `Error`, not `RawError`.

We can resolve this by using [`Http.Decorators.interpretStatus`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rgrempel/elm-http-decorators/1.0.2/Http-Decorators#interpretStatus). This decorates the `Http.send` result so the error type is `Error` instead of `RawError`. Now all our types match again!

Now we need to handle the response. It's a string and not JSON so we won't be decoding it the way we did with `authUser`. We'll [map the response](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.1/Task#map) to transform it with a `responseText` function that we'll define in a moment.

Before that, we'll define the command: 
   
```elm    
fetchProtectedQuoteCmd : Model -> Cmd Msg
fetchProtectedQuoteCmd model = 
    Task.perform HttpError FetchProtectedQuoteSuccess <| fetchProtectedQuote model 
```

We're quite familiar with these commands now and there are no surprises here. We'll use the same `HttpError` that we used for fetching the unprotected quote and we'll create the `FetchProtectedQuoteSuccess` message shortly.

```elm    
-- Extract GET plain text response to get protected quote    
    
responseText : Http.Response -> String
responseText response = 
    case response.value of 
        Http.Text t ->
            t 
        _ ->
            ""
```

Since we're not using `getString` we need to extract the plain text from the result of our HTTP request. Type annotation says, "`responseText` takes a response and returns a string" which is our new protected quote. The type of the [response](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-http/3.0.1/Http#Response) is a record that contains, among other things, a `value`. If the [response value](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-http/3.0.1/Http#Value) is a text string we'll return the text. In any other case we'll return an empty string.

```elm
-- Messages

type Msg 
    ...
    | GetProtectedQuote
    | FetchProtectedQuoteSuccess String
    ...

-- Update

update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
    case msg of
        ...

        GetProtectedQuote ->
            ( model, fetchProtectedQuoteCmd model )

        FetchProtectedQuoteSuccess newPQuote ->
            ( { model | protectedQuote = newPQuote }, Cmd.none )  
            
        ...
```

There are no new concepts in the implementation of the messages here. `GetProtectedQuote` returns the command and `FetchProtectedQuoteSuccess` updates the model. 

```elm
-- If user is logged in, show button and quote; if logged out, show a message instructing them to log in
protectedQuoteView = 
    let
        -- If no protected quote, apply a class of "hidden"
        hideIfNoProtectedQuote : String
        hideIfNoProtectedQuote = 
            if String.isEmpty model.protectedQuote then "hidden" else ""

    in        
        if loggedIn then
            div [] [
                p [ class "text-center" ] [
                    button [ class "btn btn-info", onClick GetProtectedQuote ] [ text "Grab a protected quote!" ]
                ]
                -- Blockquote with protected quote: only show if a protectedQuote is present in model
                , blockquote [ class hideIfNoProtectedQuote ] [ 
                    p [] [text model.protectedQuote] 
                ]
            ]    
        else
            p [ class "text-center" ] [ text "Please log in or register to see protected quotes." ]
                    
...

, div [ class "jumbotron text-left" ] [
    -- Login/Register form or user greeting
    authBoxView 
], div [] [
    h2 [ class "text-center" ] [ text "Protected Chuck Norris Quotes" ]
    -- Protected quotes
    , protectedQuoteView
]
```  

In the `let`, we'll add a `protectedQuoteView` under the `authBoxView` variable. We'll use a variable called `hideIfNoProtectedQuote` with an expression to output a `hidden` class to the `blockquote`. This will prevent the element from being shown if there is no quote. 

We'll represent logged in and logged out states using the `loggedIn` variable we declared earlier. When logged in we'll show a button to `GetProtectedQuote` and the quote. When logged out we'll show a paragraph with copy telling the user to log in or register. 

At the bottom of our `view` function, we'll add a `div` with a heading and our `protectedQuoteView`.

Check it out in the browser--our app is almost finished!

### Persisting Logins with Local Storage

We have the primary functionality done now. Our app gets quotes, allows registration, login, and gets authorized quotes. The last thing we'll do is persist logins.

We don't want our logged-in users to lose their data if they refresh their browser or leave and come back. To do this we'll implement `localStorage` with Elm using [JavaScript interop](http://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html). This is a way to take advantage of features of JS in Elm code. After all, Elm compiles to JavaScript so it only makes sense that we would be able to do this.

When we're done, our completed `Main.elm` will look like this:

**[Main.elm - Persisting Logins with Local Storage](https://github.com/kmaida/auth0-elm-with-jwt-api/blob/step-6/src/Main.elm)**

The first things you may notice are changes to our `Main` module and program:

```elm
port module Main exposing (..)

...

main : Program (Maybe Model)
main = 
    Html.programWithFlags
        { init = init 
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = \_ -> Sub.none
        , view = view
        }
```

We need to switch from `program` to `programWithFlags`. The type therefore changes from `Program Never` to `Program (Maybe Model)`. This means we might have a model provided at initialization. If the model is already in local storage it will be available. If we don't have anything stored when we arrive we'll initialize without it.

So where does this initial model come from? We need to write a little bit of JavaScript in our `index.html`:

```js
...    
    var storedState = localStorage.getItem('model');
    var startingState = storedState ? JSON.parse(storedState) : null;
    var elmApp = Elm.Main.fullscreen(startingState);

    elmApp.ports.setStorage.subscribe(function(state) {
        localStorage.setItem('model', JSON.stringify(state));
    });
    
    elmApp.ports.removeStorage.subscribe(function() {
        localStorage.removeItem('model');
    });
...
```

There is no Elm here. We will use JavaScript to check local storage for previously saved `model` data. Then we'll establish the `startingState` in a ternary that checks `storedState` for model data. If data is found we'll `JSON.parse` it and pass it to our Elm app. If there is no model yet, we'll pass `null`.

Then we need to set up ports so we can use features of `localStorage` in our Elm code. We'll call one port `setStorage` and subscribe to it so we can do something with messages that come through the port. When `state` data is sent we'll use the `setItem` method to set a `model` and save the stringified data to `localStorage`. The `removeStorage` port will remove the `model` item from `localStorage`. We'll use this when logging out.

Now we'll go back to `Main.elm`:

```elm
-- Helper to update model and set localStorage with the updated model

setStorageHelper : Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
setStorageHelper model = 
    ( model, setStorage model )
```

We need a helper function of a specific type to save the model to local storage in multiple places in our `update`. Because the `update` type always expects a tuple with a model and command message returned, we need our helper to take the model as an argument and return the same type of tuple. We'll understand how this fits in a little more in a moment.

```elm
-- Messages

...

-- Ports

port setStorage : Model -> Cmd msg  
port removeStorage : Model -> Cmd msg

-- Update

update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
    case msg of
        ...

        GetTokenSuccess newToken ->
            setStorageHelper { model | token = newToken, password = "", errorMsg = "" }

        ...

        FetchProtectedQuoteSuccess newPQuote ->
            setStorageHelper { model | protectedQuote = newPQuote }
            
        LogOut ->
            ( { model | username = "", protectedQuote = "", token = "" }, removeStorage model )    
```                

We need to define the type annotation for our `setStorage` and `removeStorage` ports. They'll take a model and return a command. The lowercase `msg` is significant because this is an [effect manager](http://guide.elm-lang.org/effect_managers) and its type is actually `Cmd a`. It does not send messages back to the program. Keep in mind that using `Cmd Msg` here will result in a compiler error.

Finally, we're going to replace some of our `update` returns with the `setStorageHelper` and use the `removeStorage` command for logging out. This helper will return the tuple that our `update` function expects from all branches so we won't have to worry about type mismatches.

We will call `setStorageHelper` and pass the model updates that we want to propagate to the app and save to local storage. We're saving the model to storage when the user is successfully granted a token and when they get a protected quote. On logout, we'll remove the `localStorage` `model` item.

Now when we authenticate, local storage will keep our data so when we refresh or come back later, we won't lose our login state.

If everything compiles and works as expected, we're done with our basic Chuck Norris Quoter application!

## Aside: Using Auth0 with Elm

Auth0 provides registration, login, and authentication with JSON Web Tokens. We can add Auth0 authentication to an Elm app by setting up a couple of additional Elm modules and importing them for use in an app's `Main.elm` file. [Marcus Griep](http://twitter.com/neoeinstein) has a great [Elm Workshop with 0.17 available on GitHub](https://github.com/Cimpress-MSWLSC/elm-workshop/blob/master/elm-workshop.md) that includes an [Auth0.elm module](https://github.com/Cimpress-MSWLSC/elm-workshop/blob/master/src/Auth0.elm) and an [Authentication.elm module](https://github.com/Cimpress-MSWLSC/elm-workshop/blob/master/src/Authentication.elm).

These modules are great resources to help you implement Auth0 with Elm. We will introduce and build on them in a new app to demonstrate how to use Auth0's lock widget with JSON Web Tokens. The modules will be imported into our `Main.elm` file and we'll use JS interop to interface with [Auth0's lock component](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock).

![elm with Auth0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YiMihi/elm-with-jwt/master/article-assets/aside-auth0.jpg)

### Auth0 Lock Interop and Local Storage

In our `index.html` file, we'll use JavaScript to implement ports that instantiate the Auth0 lock and log out:

{% highlight html %}

    </head>
    
    <body>
    </body>
    
    <script src="//cdn.auth0.com/js/lock-9.1.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        var lock = new Auth0Lock(<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>, <YOUR_CLIENT_DOMAIN>);
        var storedProfile = localStorage.getItem('profile');
        var storedToken = localStorage.getItem('token');
        var authData = storedProfile && storedToken ? { profile: JSON.parse(storedProfile), token: storedToken } : null;
        var elmApp = Elm.Main.fullscreen(authData);

        elmApp.ports.auth0showLock.subscribe(function(opts) {
            opts.connections = ['Username-Password-Authentication'];

            lock.show(opts, function(err, profile, token) {
                var result = { err: null, ok: null };

                if (!err) {
                    result.ok = { profile: profile, token: token };
                    localStorage.setItem('profile', JSON.stringify(profile));
                    localStorage.setItem('token', token);
                } else {
                    result.err = err.details;

                    // Ensure that optional fields are on the object
                    result.err.name = result.err.name ? result.err.name : null;
                    result.err.code = result.err.code ? result.err.code : null;
                    result.err.statusCode = result.err.statusCode ? result.err.statusCode : null;
                }
                elmApp.ports.auth0authResult.send(result);
            });
        });

        elmApp.ports.auth0logout.subscribe(function(opts) {
            localStorage.removeItem('profile');
            localStorage.removeItem('token');
        });
    </script>
</html>    
{% endhighlight html %}

First we need to add our compiled Elm files as well as the Auth0 lock widget JavaScript file:

{% highlight html %}
<script src="Main.js"></script>
<script src="Auth0.js"></script>
<script src="Authentication.js"></script>

...

<script src="//cdn.auth0.com/js/lock-9.1.min.js"></script>
{% endhighlight html %}

Then we'll instantiate a lock instance:

```js
var lock = new Auth0Lock(<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>, <YOUR_CLIENT_DOMAIN>);
```

Next we'll set up the JS to instantiate the Elm application with flags and ports to interoperate with the lock widget and `localStorage`. We'll request a stored profile and token and if available, we'll recreate an object that matches the record we'll use in the `Auth0.elm` module for a `LoggedInUser`. Then we'll create ports to show the lock widget and perform logout, adding and removing items from local storage accordingly.

### Auth0 Module

Next we'll build our `Auth0.elm` module:

```elm
-- Auth0.elm

module Auth0
    exposing
        ( AuthenticationState(..)
        , AuthenticationError
        , AuthenticationResult
        , RawAuthenticationResult
        , Options
        , defaultOpts
        , LoggedInUser
        , UserProfile
        , Token
        , mapResult
        )


type alias LoggedInUser =
    { profile : UserProfile
    , token : Token
    }


type AuthenticationState
    = LoggedOut
    | LoggedIn LoggedInUser


type alias Options =
    {}


type alias UserProfile =
    { email : String
    , email_verified : Bool
    , name : String
    , nickname : String
    , picture : String
    , user_id : String
    }


type alias Token =
    String


type alias AuthenticationError =
    { name : Maybe String
    , code : Maybe String
    , description : String
    , statusCode : Maybe Int
    }


type alias AuthenticationResult =
    Result AuthenticationError LoggedInUser


type alias RawAuthenticationResult =
    { err : Maybe AuthenticationError
    , ok : Maybe LoggedInUser
    }


mapResult : RawAuthenticationResult -> AuthenticationResult
mapResult result =
    case ( result.err, result.ok ) of
        ( Just msg, _ ) ->
            Err msg

        ( Nothing, Nothing ) ->
            Err { name = Nothing, code = Nothing, statusCode = Nothing, description = "No information was received from the authentication provider" }

        ( Nothing, Just user ) ->
            Ok user
            
            
defaultOpts : Options
defaultOpts =
    {}
```

This module handles responses from Auth0 authentication requests. It defines authentication state and types for the user's profile, JWT, authentication errors, and results. 

### Authentication Module

Now we need a way for the Auth0 module to interface with the authentication logic for our Elm app. We'll set this up in an `Authentication.elm` file:

```elm
-- Authentication.elm

module Authentication
    exposing
        ( Msg(..)
        , Model
        , init
        , update
        , handleAuthResult
        , tryGetUserProfile
        , isLoggedIn
        )

import Auth0


type alias Model =
    { state : Auth0.AuthenticationState
    , lastError : Maybe Auth0.AuthenticationError
    , showLock : Auth0.Options -> Cmd Msg
    , logOut : () -> Cmd Msg
    }


init : (Auth0.Options -> Cmd Msg) -> (() -> Cmd Msg) -> Maybe Auth0.LoggedInUser -> Model
init showLock logOut initialData =
    { state =
        case initialData of
            Just user ->
                Auth0.LoggedIn user

            Nothing ->
                Auth0.LoggedOut
    , lastError = Nothing
    , showLock = showLock
    , logOut = logOut
    }


type Msg
    = AuthenticationResult Auth0.AuthenticationResult
    | ShowLogIn
    | LogOut
    

update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        AuthenticationResult result ->
            let
                ( newState, error ) =
                    case result of
                        Ok user ->
                            ( Auth0.LoggedIn user, Nothing )

                        Err err ->
                            ( model.state, Just err )
            in
                ( { model | state = newState, lastError = error }, Cmd.none )

        ShowLogIn ->
            ( model, model.showLock Auth0.defaultOpts )

        LogOut ->
            ( { model | state = Auth0.LoggedOut }, model.logOut () )


handleAuthResult : Auth0.RawAuthenticationResult -> Msg
handleAuthResult =
    Auth0.mapResult >> AuthenticationResult


tryGetUserProfile : Model -> Maybe Auth0.UserProfile
tryGetUserProfile model =
    case model.state of
        Auth0.LoggedIn user ->
            Just user.profile

        Auth0.LoggedOut ->
            Nothing


isLoggedIn : Model -> Bool
isLoggedIn model =
    case model.state of
        Auth0.LoggedIn _ ->
            True

        Auth0.LoggedOut ->
            False
```

We need to import the `Auth0` module so we can reference it. The model provides a way for our `Main` Elm module to send data into the `Authentication` module. We'll do this by passing arguments to `Authentication`'s `init` function from the `Main` module. We'll establish a `Msg` union type and then in our `update` function, we can handle authentication results, show the lock widget, and log out. 

### Implementing Auth0 in Main.elm

Our modules are ready to use. We'll import them in our `Main.elm` program file and create our `model`, `update`, and `view`:

```elm
-- Main.elm

port module Main exposing (..)

import Html exposing (..)
import Html.App as Html
import Html.Events exposing (..)
import Html.Attributes exposing (..)
import Auth0
import Authentication


main : Program (Maybe Auth0.LoggedInUser)
main =
    Html.programWithFlags
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        , view = view
        }


type alias Model =
    { authModel : Authentication.Model
    }


-- Init

init : Maybe Auth0.LoggedInUser -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init initialUser =
    ( Model (Authentication.init auth0showLock auth0logout initialUser), Cmd.none )


-- Messages

type Msg
    = AuthenticationMsg Authentication.Msg


-- Ports

port auth0showLock : Auth0.Options -> Cmd msg
port auth0authResult : (Auth0.RawAuthenticationResult -> msg) -> Sub msg
port auth0logout : () -> Cmd msg


-- Update

update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        AuthenticationMsg authMsg ->
            let
                ( authModel, cmd ) =
                    Authentication.update authMsg model.authModel
            in
                ( { model | authModel = authModel }, Cmd.map AuthenticationMsg cmd )



-- Subscriptions

subscriptions : a -> Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
    auth0authResult (Authentication.handleAuthResult >> AuthenticationMsg)


-- View

view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    div [ class "container" ]
        [ div [ class "jumbotron text-center" ]
            [ div []
                (case Authentication.tryGetUserProfile model.authModel of
                    Nothing ->
                        [ p [] [ text "Please log in" ] ]

                    Just user ->
                        [ p [] [ img [ src user.picture ] [] ]
                        , p [] [ text ("Hello, " ++ user.name ++ "!") ]
                        ]
                )
            , p []
                [ button
                    [ class "btn btn-primary"
                    , onClick
                        (AuthenticationMsg
                            (if Authentication.isLoggedIn model.authModel then
                                Authentication.LogOut
                                else
                                Authentication.ShowLogIn
                            )
                        )
                    ]
                    [ text
                        (if Authentication.isLoggedIn model.authModel then
                            "Logout"
                            else
                            "Login"
                        )
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
```

We'll use `programWithFlags` because we want to check for an existing user and token in local storage upon initialization. The model contains the `Authentication` model record we set up earlier. 

In the `init` function, we will `init` `Authentication` and pass in arguments for the ports that show the lock and log out. We'll also pass the initial user from local storage if available (recall that we set this up in `index.html` to mirror the `LoggedInUser` type from the `Auth0` module).

We need to subscribe to the `auth0authResult` port to listen for external input from Auth0 lock logins.

> Aside: `>>` represents function chaining. 

Finally, the view displays a message and button to open the lock widget if there is no authentication data in storage, and a greeting with the user's avatar along with a logout button if there is.

## Elm: Now and Future

We made a simple app but covered a lot of ground with Elm's architecture, syntax, and implementation of features you'll likely come across in web application development. Authenticating with JWT was straightforward and packages and JS interop offer a lot of extensibility.

Elm began in 2012 as [Evan Czaplicki's Harvard senior thesis](http://elm-lang.org/papers/concurrent-frp.pdf) and it's still a newcomer in the landscape of front-end languages. That isn't stopping production use though: [NoRedInk](https://www.noredink.com) has been compiling Elm to production for almost a year ([Introduction to Elm - Richard Feldman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBHB9i8e3Kc)) with no runtime exceptions and Evan Czaplicki is deploying Elm to production at [Prezi](https://prezi.com). Elm's compiler offers a lot of test coverage "free of charge" by thoroughly checking all logic and branches. In addition, the Elm Architecture of model-view-update [inspired Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/PriorArt.html). 

Elm also has an [active community](http://elm-lang.org/community). I particularly found the [elmlang Slack](http://elmlang.herokuapp.com) to be a great place to learn about Elm and chat with knowledgeable developers who are happy to help with any questions.

There are a lot of exciting things about Elm and I'm looking forward to seeing how it continues to evolve. Static typing, functional, reactive programming, and friendly documentation and compiler messaging make it a clean and speedy coding experience. There's also a peace of mind that Elm provides--the fear of production runtime errors is a thing of the past. Once Elm compiles, it _just works_, and that is something that no other JavaScript SPA frameworks can offer.
